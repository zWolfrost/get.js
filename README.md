## Changelog and Breaking Changes
**Watch out for this section if you wish to migrate to a different version.** <br>
*New patches are usually bugfixes and/or documentation clarification*

- **v1.1.0**: Removed "call" method as i didn't feel like it fits in the package theme. Also because it was just the following code: `window[name](...args)` <br> Added the "root" method.

## How to use
*Note that you can change the cdn version and/or package type of the library with whatever version you want. Template:*<br>
